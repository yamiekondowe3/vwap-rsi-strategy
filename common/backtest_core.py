"""Shared bar-loop backtester driven by a signal frame plus an ExitPolicy.

Both strategies (and the random-entry placebo) produce a signal frame and
run it through this identical core, which is what makes the placebo
comparison valid: strategy and control differ ONLY in which bars they enter
on, never in how positions are managed or costed.

Signal frame must carry: open, high, low, close, atr, spread (optional),
long_signal, short_signal. Fills execute at the NEXT bar's open, exits at
the level reached, both crossing the spread against the trader.
